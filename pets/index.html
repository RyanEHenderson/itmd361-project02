        Pets have always been a large part of my life. I've had pets ever
        since I was a baby. We had two Dalmations, Zeke and Kahlua. Zeke was
        deaf. Other than that I don't really know much about them, since I was
        very young when they died.

        After they died, my sister got Gracie, a
        miniature schnauzer, for Christmas 2004 as a puppy from out local humane
        society. She lived a good, long life, passing away in July of 2018. In
        February of 2010, we went to Missouri and picked out Pepper. We didn't
        know it at the time (in fact we suspected otherwise), but he was also
        a purebred miniature schnauzer. Gracie and Pepper (usually) got along
        pretty well. In fact, as they were both schnauzers they were our rabbit
        catching dogs. They worked well together doing this, Gracie would flush
        the rabbit out of the garden and Pepper would chase it down and catch
        it. Unfortunately around the summer of 2016, Pepper's spleen had
        swollen quite large due to cancer, and it had to be removed. The vet
        gave him an estimate of 6 months after that to live. However he managed
        to hang on, preceding Gracie in death by only a month.

        Now we have two more dogs, Piper and Oscar. We got them together in
        August 2018 as rescues, they had been found hanging their heads out of a
        window to get fresh air. We don't know what breed(s) they are, nor do
        we know exactly how old they are (though we estimate they were 7 or 8
        when we got them). But Piper is constantly full of energy and can't seem
        to get enough running in. Oscar also loves to run, but has bad legs and
        will be lame the next day if we let him run too much. He also had a
        cataract in his eye that burst, so we had to have that eye removed.

        Dogs are not the only pets we've had though. My sister loves the pet
        rats that she's had. Many people shy away from the idea of having rats
        as pets, but they are actually quite good pets and can also be pretty
        cute. We started out with Bert and Doodle, two males. We later got
        Minnie, Macy, and Mango. A little bit after Bert and Doodle had both
        died, we got Oreo and Patches. My sister now has two more rats at her
        apartment at school, Ducky and Gibbs.
