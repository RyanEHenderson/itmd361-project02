      <h3>Student</h3>
      <p>
        I am a co-terminal student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I
        started my B.S. Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology in
        August 2019 and will complete it in May 2023. I will be starting my
        Master of Cyber Forensics and Security in January 2021 and will complete
        it in the same year as my bachelor's.
      </p>
      <h3>Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I have been doing development work since the 7th grade. I started out
        with writing Minecraft server plugins in Java, and have expanded my
        skills since then. While Java is the language I am most comfortable
        with, I am experienced in Python and JavaScript, and also have
        used some C++. I have taken courses at IIT to prepare me for the
        CompTIA A+, Network+, and Linux+ exams, and I am currently taking
        futher training courses in order to get my Network+ certification.
      </p>
      <h3>Gamer</h3>
      <p>
        Like I mentioned above, I was developing for Minecraft since 7th grade.
        So naturally, I was also playing the game. To this day, Minecraft is
        still one of my favorite games, even though I almost exclusively play
        on one server, one that I am a staff member and developer for. In
        addition to Minecraft, I also play quite a bit of Rocket League, having
        amassed over 1000 hours in the game. I am also an active member for a
        Rocket League community, where I both play and help with some of the
        staff side. Finally the 3rd game that I play the most is Skyrim. Between
        Legendary and Special Editions I have played for over 800 hours, nearly
        all of that time in heavily modded games. I am a moderator for two
        Skyrim modding communities, and develop and manage a Discord bot
        (written in NodeJS) for three.
